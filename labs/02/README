1) What does it mean to say that the Media class is an "abstract class"?



2) What line of code makes Media an abstract class?  Explain briefly.



3) The Instructors released the code with two errors.  Don't worry you 
   don't need to fix them and they don't effect the accuracy of the program.  
   Both errors relate to memory leaks.
  
  a) Identify the two locations where memory is leaked 
     (i.e., the source of the original memory).



  b) For each, identify the (general) command needed and where it should be 
     placed in your code.  HINT: mediaLibrary is missing a normally 
     standard function. It shouldn't be.
