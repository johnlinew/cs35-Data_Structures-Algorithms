Describe the biggest challenge you faced on this lab.

  Getting hashTable-inl.h to work was a real pain. I had a lot of trouble
  there. Otherwise, me being a highschooler, made the math portion of the
  lab a little confusing, such as the way to get all of the possible plays
  given a certain set of tiles. I was fine with choice 2, not so much for
  choice 3.
