CS35 Lab 4

Name 1: (First and Last Name)
Name 2: (NONE if you worked alone)

userName1: (e.g., asoni1)
userName2: 

---------------------------------

1) In class, we discussed the advantages and disadvantages of array lists. 
Which methods of the MovieLinkedList class are "fast" (i.e., O(1)) 
and which are not efficient (i.e., O(N) for a linked list of size N).


2) Think of the methods remove and playFrom. For each of these methods,
is the Big-O performance the same if we used an array list?  If yes,
describe the big-Os.  If no, are there scenarios where an array list
or linked list would be more efficient for these methods in practical terms?

3) You have implemented a singly-linked list in this lab.
An alternative implementation, called a doubly-linked list, uses a node 
implementation that has a pointer to the previous node in addition to a 
pointer to the next node. Which, if any, methods in the movieList.h
interface would be more efficient (in big-O terms)
with this alternate representation relative to a singly-linked list.

Lab Questionnaire 
(None of these questions will have an impact on your grade, this is to 
help provide use the feedback we need to make the course the best it can be)

(provide your answer as a single integer on the line below).


How difficult did you find this lab?
(1-5, with 5 being very difficult and 1 being very easy)


Describe the biggest challenge you fast on this lab.
