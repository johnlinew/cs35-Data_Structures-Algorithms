---------------------------------

Describe your programs input, output, and general function:

  The program takes in three integers, representing rows, columns, and walls.
  Next, it takes in 'n = walls' number of positions, representing walls.  The
  program then proceeds to place those walls, build the maze and solve it,
  two ways, one using breadth first search and one using depth first search.
  It outputs the coord positions of each coord in the solved path of the
  maze, as well as the maze length, and a text based maze with the solution
  mapped out in stars.

What challenges did you encounter? And how did you address them?

  Debugging issues and determining remaining consistent with x and y
  (i.e. rows and columns)

In plain english: Explain how a stack matches depth-first-search
traversal of a maze? Why does a queue match breadth-first-search
traversal?

  A stack matches breadth first search because it processes the most recent
  found values first, before getting to the values farther out in the maze.
  A queue checks the next in line, by putting newfound information on the
  back of the list.

Find the prettiest generated maze, in your opinion, and copy and paste
it below.
 start --> * * * * * 
           0 1 0 0 * 
           0 0 0 1 * 
           0 0 0 1 * 
           0 0 0 0 * <-- finish
